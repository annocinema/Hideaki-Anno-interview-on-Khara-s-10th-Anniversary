00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,290
[Khara 10 year anniversary.Eva's past,
Eva's future, and Studio Khara today.]

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,330
It's a pleasure to have you.

3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,030
It's pleasure...

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,300
It's a pleasure to be here.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,170
First off, congratulations on
the studio's 10th anniversary.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:24,600
Thank you.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,500
Congratulations.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,170
Yes.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,310
How does it feel?

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,240
I'm glad it's lasted 10 years.

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,280
Lasted?

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,480
Very glad.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,180
I'm glad we're able to
have an exhibition like this.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,050
I'm very thankful.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,150
What does this
exhibition have in store for us?

16
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,520
Yes.
What does this
exhibition have in store for us?

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,150
What does this
exhibition have in store for us?

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,060
Well, it's everything our company has worked
on these last 10 years squished together.

19
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,530
We wanted it to be obvious at a glance.

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,400
There are a lot of pieces on display,

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,700
Yes.
There are a lot of pieces on display,

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,340
but is there anything you as
a director, or just you yourself,

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,870
want people to pay attention to particularly?

24
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,480
There's a lot of content available.

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,420
But it's not straight from the movies. It's the
intricate process behind what you see on screen.

26
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,460
I think that's where I want people's attention.

27
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,830
Following that, I'm
curious about about one thing.

28
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,290
Yes.
Following that, I'm
curious about about one thing.

29
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:21,730
Following that, I'm
curious about about one thing.

30
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,700
The Shin Godzilla models.

31
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,470
Ah, the maquette.

32
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,670
Yes. What is the story behind those?

33
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:38,310
Originally we just planned to
make Godzilla in CG form. All of it.

34
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,780
But we thought it might be
better to create a physical model

35
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:50,020
and then scan that model
instead of starting from CG.

36
00:01:50,020 --> 00:02:00,070
Instead of creating a CG model out of nothing,
we wanted to start with a physical model.

37
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,670
There were no original sketches?

38
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,670
I had the rough drawings that I jotted down,

39
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:17,250
but Takeya Takayuki made the physical
model. Then Shirogumi Inc. made the CG model.

40
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,220
and that became the face of our project.

41
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,750
I like having a physical model.

42
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,730
The CG is very impressive.

43
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,330
Thank you.

44
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,400
Was there any challenges
with turning the model into CG?

45
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,970
Yeah, there was. I mean it's difficult
to give CG the same air as the maquettes,

46
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:44,510
but they have indicators that
made it easy to point out what we wanted.

47
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:52,450
The direction we wanted to go in was
much more defined than if we started from CG.

48
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,190
It was reassuring.

49
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:00,190
Without an object, it feels wrong.

50
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,960
Because it wasn't just in our heads,

51
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:10,640
because we were working with something
right in front of us, the CG Godzilla turned out ok.

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,440
So, what was the reasoning behind
Godzilla's 2nd, 3rd, and 4th forms?

53
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,370
Yes.
So, what was the reasoning behind
Godzilla's 2nd, 3rd, and 4th forms?

54
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:22,050
So, what was the reasoning behind
Godzilla's 2nd, 3rd, and 4th forms?

55
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,850
From what I remember,
it's nothing all that special.

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,820
It's not as visually or cinematically
interesting if Godzilla didn't transform.

57
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,166
Toho was originally against having it.

58
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:42,330
Godzilla is so iconic and
they didn't want to threaten that.

59
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,000
That's where an Bandai stepped in, very
excited about the prospect of 3 products.

60
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,440
Because of that, we managed.

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,410
Like, look, look, look it'll sell like crazy.

62
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,920
We struggled, but eventually
got the 3 forms approved.

63
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:08,060
What's the meaning behind
"Eva's past, Eva's future"?

64
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:16,370
It reflects our representative piece. Our
company has only been around for 10 years.

65
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,340
When we decided on opening an exhibit, it made
the most sense to make Evangelion the main focus.

66
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,480
That's why it became so centered around Eva.

67
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,880
There are a lot of points to focus
on when looking at keyframes,

68
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,480
Yes.
There are a lot of points to focus
on when looking at keyframes,
69
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:32,480
There are a lot of points to focus
on when looking at keyframes,

69
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,650
but is there anything
particular to keep in mind?

70
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:43,230
Keyframes are pre-motion, so they
stand as the base for movement.

71
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,400
The layouts of each
drawing have their own quirks.

72
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,940
Oh and silhouettes.

73
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,700
Silhouettes?

74
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,470
Silhouettes.

75
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,410
The expression in the silhouette of each
frame as well as the placement of the faces.

76
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,180
Keep that in mind while going through.

77
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,820
The face placement is essential.

78
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,580
In what way?

79
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,320
Viewers find faces first.

80
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,590
Within the first 3 seconds of a frame,
their eye goes straight to the face.

81
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,060
Only after that do they begin
to see the rest of the screen.

82
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,700
The immediate line of sight is
on the face - or really, the eyes.

83
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,540
You search for the eyes in the frame.

84
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,040
Once you find them you
look where they're looking.

85
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,750
This is a question long in the making, but
where did the idea for Evangelion come from?

86
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:41,350
The idea was from 20 years ago. The TV
version of Eva was - wait more than 20 years.

87
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:50,200
Eva was... well robot anime was my specialty.

88
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,500
I wanted to try making something
I could approach with confidence.

89
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,880
That's... that's what ended up becoming Eva.

90
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,110
I wanted to make something entertaining.

91
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,180
Congratulations on having Shin Godzilla
nominated for buzzword of the year?

92
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,080
Thank you.

93
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,420
How do you feel?

94
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,190
I don't feel one way or another.

95
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,460
What if you won?

96
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,560
It won't. They should choose someone else.

97
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,060
It won't be me.

98
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:32,300
What would you say has been the hardest part
of these past 10 years as a manager and creator?

99
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,040
After Evangelion 3.0 was tough.

100
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,070
Probably the hardest.

101
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,540
Which part exactly?

102
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,480
Honestly, I ran out of ideas.

103
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,180
I overworked myself.

104
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,820
In the following 10 years, is
there anything you want to do?

105
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,130
I want to keep creating entertaining media.

106
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,330
I was wondering about the next Eva movie,
or well the last film.

107
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,330
Yes.
I was wondering about the
next Eva movie,or well the last film.

108
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,130
I was wondering about the
next Eva movie,or well the last film.

109
00:06:59,130 --> 00:06:59,730
We're working on it.
I was wondering about the

110
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,970
I was wondering about the

111
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,900
We're working on it.
I was wondering about the
next Eva movie,or well the last film.

112
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,300
When do you think that will debut?

113
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,910
I'm not sure. It's not a
decision just for our company.

114
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,580
The distribution companies and
such have a say in it, so I'm not sure.

115
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,480
I look forward to seeing it.

116
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,840
Thank you.
I look forward to seeing it.

117
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,210
Thank you.

118
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,920
I apologize for the interruption,
but that's all the time we have for today.

119
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,180
It's fine.
I apologize for the interruption,
but that's all the time we have for today.

120
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,790
I apologize for the interruption,
but that's all the time we have for today.

121
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,350
Is there anyone you have your eye on?

122
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,120
Nope.
Not just in the production world.

123
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,520
Not just in the production world.

124
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:24,690
None, really.
Not just in the production world.

125
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,260
No athlete or TV personality?
None, really.

126
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,490
No athlete or TV personality?

127
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:26,560
No.
No athlete or TV personality?

128
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,330
No.

129
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,030
A producer?

130
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,530
No.

131
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,890
Really?

132
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,330
No.

133
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,060
By the way...

134
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,130
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have for today.
